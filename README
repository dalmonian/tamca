Tamca (Tomato in lojban) is a simple timer meant to be used for the Pommodoro
Technique.

It can be used from a shell with the tamca command. If the dwm window manager is
running, it will use it's status bar to display the remaining time instead of
stdout.

Tamca requires mplayer to play the sound at the end of the timer. To use the dwm
feature, it needs dwm (obviously) and xsetroot.
